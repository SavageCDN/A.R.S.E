I see you are trying to set up an Arma 3 Role Playing Server.  While we all wish you the best of luck please note the following reasons it will fail:
 
STARTUP
[ ] All you have is an idea
[ ] All you have is an idea and a Teamspeak server
[ ] All you have is an idea, a Teamspeak server, and an Enjin website
 
CONTENT
[ ]  Despite your claim of having "totally custom content" you actually have none to speak of
[ ] The content you claim to be using is content created by a member of the Arma community and you have yet to get permission to use it
[ ] The content you claim to be using is ripped from other games/sources
[ ] The content you claim to be using is just stuff you've downloaded off Steam Workshop (see #2)
[ ] Acquiring proper permissions sounds like a chore...
 
PERFORMANCE
[ ] "ZERO LAG" is not a technical term
[ ] While your mission may run some "optimized scripts" your dedicated server is a VPS hosted by Vilayer
[ ] Claiming good performance on a server that doesn't yet exist is silly
 
COMMUNITY
[ ] Your "team" sounds like one guy - you
[ ] We're a bit worried.. one of your requirements is "mature" - can you elaborate?
[ ] The last guy who got this canned response also claimed to have the "Best admin staff"
[ ] The last guy who got this canned response also claimed to have the "Best role playing members"
[ ] All of the above
 
HISTORY
[ ] While the Arma Life community in general has an exemplary track record of honesty and maturity, we're just not feeling that vibe here
[ ] Post like this are a weekly occurrence around here
[ ] Forum regulars habitually rip these types of threads... well... to threads :)  What makes you think this one will be spared?
